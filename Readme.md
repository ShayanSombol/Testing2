# AcuityMD Challenge

Thanks for your interest in joining the AcuityMD team. In this challenge, you will be working on manipulating data stored in a SQLite database. The purpose of this challenge is to replicate a real-world working environment and to test a diverse set of skills, to see how you would work with us on our team. The challenge itself is similar to the work you would be doing on our team, but with miminized complexity so it can be completed in the time allotted.
